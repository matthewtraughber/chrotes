# Chrotes
##### A simple note taking extension for Chrome

Chrotes *(chrome notes portmanteau, how original /s)* was created when I lost data for the millionth time using ```data:text/html, <html contenteditable>``` as a Chrome bookmark.

Chrotes saves data to chrome.storage.sync, which means it will sync across devices. Every chrote is unique to a page/URL. To view the chrote, click the extension button while on the correct page.

## Setup
Until I add Chrotes to the [chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions), download it here and add via Chrome interface.
