# Chrotes
##### A simple note taking extension for Chrome

Chrotes *(chrome notes portmanteau, how original /s)* was created after losing data numerous times using ```data:text/html, <html contenteditable>``` as a Chrome bookmark.

Chrotes saves data to chrome.storage.sync, which means it will sync across devices. Each chrote is unique to a page/URL. To view & edit the chrote, click the extension button while on the desired page.
